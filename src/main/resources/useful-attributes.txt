1. Common Attributes Across All Platforms
These basic attributes are available on most platforms and can be accessed using Files.readAttributes().

- basic:lastModifiedTime:      The last modified time of the file or directory.
- basic:lastAccessTime:        The last accessed time of the file or directory.
- basic:creationTime:      The creation time of the file or directory.
- basic:size:      The size of the file in bytes.
- basic:isDirectory:       Whether the path is a directory.
- basic:isRegularFile:         Whether the path is a regular file.
- basic:isSymbolicLink:        Whether the path is a symbolic link.
- basic:isOther:       Whether the path is something other than a regular file, directory, or symbolic link.
- basic:fileKey:       An object that uniquely identifies the file or directory.
2. Windows-Specific Attributes (DosFileAttributes and AclFileAttributeView)
On Windows, you can access DOS-specific attributes and access control lists (ACLs).

dos:readonly:       Whether the file is read-only.
dos:hidden:      Whether the file is hidden.
dos:system:     Whether the file is a system file.
dos:archive:         Whether the file is marked for archival.
acl:owner:       The owner of the file.
acl:acl:         The access control list (ACL) of the file.

 Linux and macOS POSIX Attributes (PosixFileAttributes)
 Linux and macOS support POSIX attributes, which include file permissions and ownership details.

posix:permissions: The file permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.
posix:owner: The owner of the file.
posix:group: The group owner of the file.


4. User-Defined Attributes (user:*)
Most modern file systems support user-defined attributes (user:*), allowing custom metadata to be attached to files. These attributes are available on some Linux and macOS systems if supported by the file system (e.g., ext4).

user:customName: Any user-defined attribute, such as "user:comment", "user:tags", etc
